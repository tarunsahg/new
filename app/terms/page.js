          <p>Welcome to WebCodeShop. These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our website, products and services. By creating an account, browsing the store or completing a purchase, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

          <h2>1. Digital products</h2>
          <p>WebCodeShop sells digital goods including PHP scripts, HTML templates, JavaScript applications and digital gift cards. All products are delivered electronically. No physical item is shipped.</p>

          <h2>2. Licenses</h2>
          <p>Unless stated otherwise on the product page, each purchase grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the product for a single end product. You may not resell, redistribute or sublicense the source code as-is.</p>

          <h2>3. Orders &amp; payment</h2>
          <p>Prices are listed in Indian Rupees (₹) and include applicable taxes unless noted. We accept UPI, major cards, RuPay, PayPal and Cash on Delivery where available. Your order is confirmed once payment is authorised, and license keys are delivered to your account and email automatically.</p>

          <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
          <p>Because products are digital and delivered instantly, all sales are generally final. If a product is broken, materially not as described, or you were charged in error, contact our support team within 7 days and we will review your request and issue a refund where appropriate.</p>

          <h2>5. Accounts</h2>
          <p>You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure and for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorised use.</p>

          <h2>6. Acceptable use</h2>
          <p>You agree not to use our products for any unlawful purpose, to infringe the rights of others, or to attempt to disrupt, reverse-engineer or compromise the security of the platform.</p>

          <h2>7. Intellectual property</h2>
          <p>All content on this site, including code, designs, logos and copy, is the property of WebCodeShop or its licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.</p>

          <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>Products are provided “as is”. To the maximum extent permitted by law, WebCodeShop is not liable for any indirect, incidental or consequential damages arising from the use of, or inability to use, our products.</p>

          <h2>9. Changes to these terms</h2>
          <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the platform after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
